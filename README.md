# Vizia Experiment

I tried out the GUI-Framework https://github.com/vizia/vizia. It's pretty good :)

The application is a very simple To-Do List. It works, but I don't think I would use it. 

Inspiration for the colors and font was this beautiful mockup by Ronas IT | UI/UX Team: https://dribbble.com/shots/22466621-Project-Management-Web-App

Vizia is very straight forward. At times it is a bit verbose. Styling works well.
